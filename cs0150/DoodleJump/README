README DoodleJump

Overview:
	My DoodleJump has 5 classes, App, PaneOrganizer, Game, Doodle, and Ledge. They are outlined down below.
		App:
			This class displays all the graphical elements and contains the class PaneOrganizer.
		 	It displays the window.
		PaneOrganizer:
			This class sets up all graphical elements and organizes them within the _root. It has 
			access to getRoot(), createBottomPane(),createGamePane(),getters for the instance 
			variables needed in Game. It contains an instance of Game, Doodle, and the Ledges.
		Game:
			This class handles all the logic of the game. Its inner classes are KeyHandler, 
 			TimeHandler, and RestartHandler. Its methods are setInstVar(), setupTimeline(), 
 			and two getters for KeyHandler and TimeHandler.
 		Doodle:
 			This class has all the information needed to make a Doodle. Its methods are setPostion(), 
			getYPosition(), getXPosition(),getShapes(), setVel(), updateVel(), updateLoc(), getVel(),
			and remove().
		Ledge:
			This class has all the information needed to make a Ledge. Its methods are setPosition(), 
			getShapes(), getYPosition(), and getXPosition().

Design Choices:
	In my DoodleJump, the PaneOrganizer handles displaying all graphically elements while the Game
	handles updating these elements.
