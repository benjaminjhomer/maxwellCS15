HANDIN:On Time

DESIGN CHOICES:

KNOWN BUGS:When running through the terminal,
I get this error "Prism-ES2 Error : GL_VERSION (major.minor) = 1.4,
however the program is still successful in launching and AndyBot finishes
the maze.

NESTING:
Nesting is where you place one method in as another methods argument.
This works when the outside method takes the return of the inside method
as its argument. This means that the inside method must return the same
type of variable that the outside's parameter is.

In AndyBot, I used nested functions to when I called solveRoadBlock.
solveRoadBlock takes an integer as its argument, one that is used in
enterPassword. Since this integer is randomly generated by getHint,
I just passed the integer returned by getHint straight into solveRoadBlock,
thus streamlining my code.
