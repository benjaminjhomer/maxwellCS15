README TETRIS

Overview:
	My Tetris has 5 classes. They are:
		App:
			This class displays all the graphical elements and contains the class PaneOrganizer.
		 	It displays the window.
		 PaneOrganizer:
		 	This class is responsible for organizing all the Panes on the screen
 			graphically. It has access to the following methods: getRoot, createMenuPane,
 			setScore, pauseLabel, addGameOver,createGamePane. It has two inner classes,
			QuitHandler and Restart Handler.
		GameLogic:
			This class handles all logic for the game. Its methods are: setupTimeline,
	 		moveShapeDown, clearRows, and getScore. It has two inner classes, TimHandler
	 		and KeyHandler.
	 	Shape:
	 		This class makes 4 Blocks into 7 random shapes. Its methods are:
 			checkValidity, moveDown, moveSidewards, rotate, and addToBlockPos.
		Block:
			Wrapper for the _rect. Has three getters, getNode, getXIndex, and getYIndex.
Design Choices:
	In my Tetris, I decided to use a GridPane for easy expandability and because it 
	corresponded very easily with my logical position array. It was also cleaner with 
	the math and positioning.
Known Bugs:
	None.
