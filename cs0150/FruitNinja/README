FruitNinja README

OVERVIEW:
    My FruitNinja has 9 classes. A brief description of each is described below
      - App
        Instantiates top-level class of FruitNinja. Starts game and organizes
        the javaFX.
      - FruitNinja
        This class is the top level class. It is a subclass of CS15 Game. It
        handles what happens when the blade hits an object, bomb or fruit. It
        also control the likelyhood of each fruit launch. Contains all instances
        of fruit.
      - Fruit
        This is a subclass of CSFruit and super class of Apple, Pear, Peach, and
        Lemon. It is an abstract class that implements Choppable.
      - Apple
        Subclass of Fruit. Is contained by FruitNinja. This has a score value of
        1. launchItem() instantiates it. 
      - Pear
        Subclass of Fruit. Is contained by FruitNinja. This has a score value of
        3. launchItem() instantiates it.
      - Peach
        Subclass of Fruit. Is contained by FruitNinja. This has a score value of
        4. launchItem() instantiates it.
      - Lemon
        Subclass of Fruit. Is contained by FruitNinja. This has a score value of
        2. launchItem() instantiates it.
      - Bomb
        This is a subclass of CSBomb. It is contained within FruitNinja.
      - Choppable
        Bomb and Fruit both implement Choppable. All Choppables can use getValue()
        and bombOrNoBomb.

DESIGN CHOICES:
    In onBladeContact, I need check to see if the last object touched with the
    blade is a bomb or not. This variable is of declared type Choppable because
    both bombs and fruits are Choppable. However, if it is a bomb, it needs to
    access explode(), so I get the last touched object and declare it as type
    bomb so I can use explode().
KNOWN BUGS:
    None.
