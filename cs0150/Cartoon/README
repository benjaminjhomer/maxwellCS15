README Cartoon

OVERVIEW: My Cartoon has six classes. Below is their descriptions and how they intersect.
			- App
				Instantiates PaneOrganizers and sets and shows the stage. Has a start method
			- PaneOrganizer
				This class contains Cartoon and creates a quit button. It also has a QuitHandler 
				which looks for when said quit button is pressed
			- Cartoon
				This class contains the space ship, the enemies, and the lasers. It is responsible for creating all the panes which
				are organized in the PaneOrganizer. It also has a private class that looks for arrow key presses and if the space
				bar is hit. This moves the spaceship or spawns lasers.
			- Enemy
				This class creates the enemy and moves them down the screen. It has methods to do so. It is contained by Cartoon.
			- SpaceShip
				This class creates a spaceship in the bottom pane. It is controlled through a private class in Cartoon. It is 
				contained by Cartoon.
			- Lasers
				This class creates the lasers and moves them up the screen. It has methods to do so and knows about the location 
				of the spaceship at the time it is made.It is contained by Cartoon.
			- CONSTANTS
				Has on the constants for all the classes.
				
		The actions you can do in my program are the following:
			- Left and right arrow keys move the spaceship respectively.
			- Space bar fires a laser from the front of the ship.
				
DESIGN CHOICES: 

KNOWN BUGS: I couldn't manage to get the lasers to register hitting the spaceships. I think I need to use arraylists but since 
			we just learned that I couldn't get it to work.
