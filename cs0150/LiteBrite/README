LiteBrite README

OVERVIEW:
My LiteBrite has 2 classes, LiteBox and ColorPalette. They interact in the
following way.
        -ColorPalette creates the boxes at the bottom that allow you to select
         the color you want to place down. It stores this variable as
         _currentColor and has a getter and mutator method for it. It also is
         associated with LiteBox.
        -LiteBox creates the grid and has a method that places the LitePegs. It
         uses the getter method in ColorPalette to see which color the user has
         picked to determine the color of the peg. It is also associated with
         ColorPalette.

DESIGN CHOICES:


KNOWN BUGS:
Terminal gives the error "Prism-ES2 Error : GL_VERSION (major.minor) = 1.4"
Rarely, program will start but no window shows up.

QUESTIONS:
- Which two classes are associated?

  LiteBox and ColorPalette are associated because LiteBrite needs to know about
  an instance variable of the instance of ColorPalette that created it.

- Name one getter method and one setter method used in your program.
  A getter method I used is getColor() in ColorPalette which returns _currentColor.
  A setter method I used is setColor() in ColorPalette which sets _currentColor
  to which ever color the user last picked.
